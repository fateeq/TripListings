## About
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is not hosted online yet.

The app neatly arranges a bunch of made-up trips and displays them in a responsive web page. It also features a search function which can search through trips by name.

## Tools Used
React, creat-react-app, NPM, Node.js
